Semester 1

## Assignment

This assignment is an introduction to producing form with code. Each week, we will cover a new programming concept. Using the concepts addressed, you will create a set of Processing sketches to produce 100 posters each week. Of these 100, you will make a selection of the five best.

The idea is to use randomness, repetition, interaction, and data to create dynamic systems that can produce an infinite number of unique results. The 100 posters you will bring each week will be but a small selection of possible outcomes.

The 100 posters should represent a range of experimentation and come from a number of different staring points.

## Goals

- Learning the basic principles of programming
- Applying these principles using Processing
- Creating form through code
- Iterating on ideas, sketches and designs

## Roadmap

- Weeks 1 – 6: Five new Processing sketches each week, twenty posters per sketch = one hundred posters per week
- Week 7: Selection of five best posters printed at A1 format, digital display of every poster generated
- Week 8: Discussion, review and grading

Topics discussed:

- Week 1: Introduction to computers, code, art and design
- Week 2: Variables
- Week 3: Conditionals, transformations and color
- Week 4: Loops and functions
- Week 5: Nested loops and grids
- Week 6: Arrays and pixels
- Week 7: Objects

## Criteria

- To what extent have you explored different programming principles?
- How well have you iterated on every sketch, in order to explore new forms?
- How much does each sketch differ from the previous? How much breadth does the entire collection of sketches have?
- How creative, inviting and original are the posters?
