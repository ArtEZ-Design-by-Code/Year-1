## Assignment

What does it mean to transform something? In speaking about transformation, one thinks of an “original” and an “altered” state. These states are abound in nature, politics, technology, art, humanities, perception, culture and more or less every other thing in reality.

Think about a transformation in nature: a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, or the leaves changing from “green and attached to a tree” to “brown and laying on the ground”. Bigger transformations happen as well: global warming not only transforms our climate, it also drives a transformation in our perceptions of the planet as well as other people, and ultimately transforms our politics as well. Transformations can be divisive or unifying. They can be physical or ephemeral, tactile or mental.

Your task will be to narrow the broad theme of “transformation” down to a scope that you find interesting as a research topic. You will then record a piece of reality – this can be in any medium, as long as you can load the recorded data, photograph, sound, etc. in to your coding environment. Your will then create three transformations of this recording using code. These transformations are informed by the theme you have defined yourself. The medium for these transformations is also free – the end result can be a film, a soundscape, an interactive installation, or anything else, as long as you have used code to get there.

As always, as a class you will be responsible together for the final presentation of your work. Discuss what each of you needs to exhibit your original and three transformations, and divide tasks in order to produce the final presentation.


## Goals

- Creating form through code
- Iterating on ideas, sketches and designs
- Observing and recording reality
- Altering recorded reality using code
- Improving technical abilities
- Self-learning coding and analysing coding problems

## Roadmap

-	Week 1: The assignment in one week: produce a transformation of a picture you took yourself.
-	Week 2: Narrow down the theme of transformations to a topic you will research. Begin your visual research, start recording and gathering. Sketches.
-	Week 3: Continued recording. Sketches.
-	Week 4: Continued recording. Sketches. Direction for outcome.
-	Week 5:  Sketches, development, programming, execution.
-	Week 6:  Sketches, development, programming, execution. Outcome nearly complete, discuss and implement refinements and improvements.
-	Week 7: Final presentation

## Criteria

-	How well did you manage to narrow down a broad theme to an individual topic?
-	How well do your recordings fit your topic?
-	Technical abilities – were you able to translate your ideas into code that produces interesting results?
-	Originality and ideation – is the end result enticing and original?
